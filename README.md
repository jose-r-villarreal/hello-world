# hello-world
Hi word! This is my first GitHub repository!
My name is Jose Romeo Villarreal. I was born and raised in Monterrey, NL, Mexico. Today is May 30th and this is my *first* modification of a .md file on **GitHub**.
I love hiking.
When I was doing my Master's degree in Biomedical Sciences, I was introduced to R. At the time, I didn't realize the usefulness of such an amazing tool. It was just a weird statistical program with a weird user interface that produced a ton of error messages. Later, I began to read about R because I wanted to use ggplot2 to make graphs for my presentations. Later, I began to learn more about **R** for statistical analysis. Recently I started using R Markdown and came across Yihui's work on blogdown.
I love my beatiful girlfriend *Ivette*.
